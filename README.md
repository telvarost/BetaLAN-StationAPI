# BetaLAN StationAPI Edition for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3

A StationAPI mod for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 that allows easily launching a server using the currently loaded single-player world and currently in use mod-set/configuration.
* Configure server settings and java version using GlassConfigAPI 3 (GCAPI3).
* In v1.1.0 and above a backup world zip file is created on server launch (if the config setting is turned on).
  * The backup file's name begins with an underscore (`_`) and ends with `.zip`
  * The backup file is recreated everytime the server is launched using the most recent world files

## Troubleshooting

* I strongly recommend launching the server jar from your .minecraft directory if the loading bar gets stuck at "Preparing World"
  * Most likely it crashed due to a mod incompatibility
* Sometimes the client will crash when it joins the world, this seems to be a common bug even when joining normal servers
  * Simply close the client, relaunch, and try again usually it goes away when trying to join a server the second time
